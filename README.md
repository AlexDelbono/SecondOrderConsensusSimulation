# Second order consensus simulation
The repository implements the consensus algorithm presented [here]() using a modified version of [this]() robot simulation.

The project was developed for the course "Complessit√† nei Sistemi e nelle Reti" held at Politecnico di Milano in 2015/2016.

## Install and run
For details see the robot repository and for the simulation of the algorithm launch `kobra_compl.launch`.
